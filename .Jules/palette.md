**Learning:** Even CLI tools benefit immensely from visual hierarchy. `grep` without color is hard to scan. Users expect standard tools to behave in standard ways (like supporting `--color`).
**Action:** Always check if CLI output can be enhanced with color or formatting to improve readability, but respect `auto`/`never` settings.
