## 2024-05-23 - Grep Color highlighting
**Learning:** Even CLI tools benefit immensely from visual hierarchy. `grep` without color is hard to scan. Users expect standard tools to behave in standard ways (like supporting `--color`).
**Action:** Always check if CLI output can be enhanced with color or formatting to improve readability, but respect `auto`/`never` settings.
## 2024-05-24 - Improved `ps` and `df` table alignment\n\n**Learning:** The `ps` and `df` applets print out tables. When the output goes to a terminal (`isatty(STDOUT_FILENO)` is true), the headers use ANSI escape codes `\033[1m` and `\033[0m` to make them bold. In terminal applications, numerical columns like PIDs typically look better when right-aligned because it's easier to read orders of magnitude visually. When setting formatting directives for string column labels of numerical values, it's important to match the alignment (left vs right) and formatting directives.\n\n**Action:** When printing table headers with ANSI escape codes and fixed-width columns using `printf`, place the formatting directives (like `%4s`) inside the bold tags or apply the bold tags to the entire format string (e.g., `\033[1m%4s %6s\033[0m\n`). This ensures `printf` calculates the width based on the actual visible text and prevents column misalignment. Make sure right-alignment is preserved for numbers. This was fixed for the `ps` applet in `src/core.c`.\n
